        "Difficulty: 2\n",
        "Humans produce sweat as a cooling mechanism to maintain a stable internal temperature. Which of the following best explains how the properties of water contribute to this physiological process?\n",
        "The high heat of vaporization of water allows the body to remove excess heat through a phase change of water from liquid to gas.\n",
        "(Correct)\n",
        "Explanation:\n",
        "The high heat of vaporization of water is the key property that explains how sweating cools the body. When sweat evaporates from the skin, it requires a significant amount of heat energy to change from liquid to gas. This energy is taken from the body, thus cooling it down.\n",
        "The high specific heat capacity of water allows the body to absorb a large amount of excess heat energy.\n",
        "Explanation:\n",
        "While it is true that water has a high specific heat capacity, which means it can absorb a lot of heat before increasing in temperature, this property is not directly responsible for the cooling mechanism of sweating. Sweating cools the body primarily through the process of evaporation, not through the absorption of heat.\n",
        "The high surface tension of water contributes to the physical process by which water leaves the body.\n",
        "Explanation:\n",
        "The high surface tension of water is related to the cohesive forces between water molecules, but it does not play a significant role in the cooling mechanism of sweating. The cooling effect is primarily due to the evaporation of sweat, not the surface tension.\n",
        "The high melting temperature of water allows the body to remove excess heat through a phase change of water from solid to liquid.\n",
        "Explanation:\n",
        "The high melting temperature of water refers to the temperature at which ice melts to become liquid water. This property is not relevant to the process of sweating, as sweating involves the evaporation of liquid water, not the melting of ice.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 7:\n",
        "Difficulty: 1\n",
        "Which of the following is responsible for the cohesive property of water?\n",
        "Covalent bonds between the hydrogen atoms of two adjacent water molecules\n",
        "Explanation:\n",
        "This answer is incorrect because covalent bonds do not form between the hydrogen atoms of two adjacent water molecules. Covalent bonds are the strong bonds that hold the hydrogen and oxygen atoms together within a single water molecule.\n",
        "Hydrogen bonds between water molecules and other types of molecules\n",
        "Explanation:\n",
        "This answer is incorrect because the cohesive property of water specifically refers to the attraction between water molecules themselves, not between water molecules and other types of molecules. Hydrogen bonds between water molecules and other types of molecules contribute to adhesion, not cohesion.\n",
        "Hydrogen bonds between the oxygen atoms of two adjacent water molecules\n",
        "Explanation:\n",
        "This answer is incorrect because hydrogen bonds do not form between the oxygen atoms of two adjacent water molecules. Instead, hydrogen bonds form between the hydrogen atom of one water molecule and the oxygen atom of another water molecule.\n",
        "Hydrogen bonds between the oxygen atom of one water molecule and a hydrogen atom of another water molecule\n",
        "(Correct)\n",
        "Explanation:\n",
        "This answer is correct. The cohesive property of water is due to hydrogen bonds that form between the oxygen atom of one water molecule and the hydrogen atom of another water molecule. These hydrogen bonds create a network of interconnected water molecules, which gives water its cohesive nature.\n",
        "Covalent bonds between the oxygen atom of one water molecule and a hydrogen atom of another water molecule\n",
        "Explanation:\n",
        "This answer is incorrect because covalent bonds do not form between the oxygen atom of one water molecule and a hydrogen atom of another water molecule. Covalent bonds are the strong bonds within a single water molecule, not between different water molecules.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 9:\n",
        "Difficulty: 3\n",
        "Antibiotics can be used to kill the specific pathogenic bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, that causes tuberculosis. The appearance of antibiotic-resistant strains has made it more difficult to cure M. tuberculosis infections. These antibiotic-resistant bacteria survive and pass on the genes to their offspring, making the resistant phenotype more common in the population.\n",
        "DNA analysis indicates that the genes for antibiotic resistance are not normally present in bacterial chromosomal DNA\n",
        "Which of the following statements best explains how the genes for antibiotic resistance can be transmitted between bacteria without the exchange of bacterial chromosomal DNA?\n",
        "The antibiotic-resistant bacteria release a hormone that signals neighboring bacteria to become resistant.\n",
        "The genes for antibiotic resistance are located on a plasmid that can be passed to neighboring bacteria.\n",
        "(Correct)\n",
        "The antibiotic-resistant bacteria are the result of bacteria that specifically modify their own chromosomal DNA to neutralize the antibiotics.\n",
        "The antibiotic alters the bacterial genome of each bacterium, which results in an antibiotic-resistant population.\n",

        "Question 10:\n",
        "Difficulty: 2\n",
        "Two types of cholesterol transport proteins, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL), bind to cholesterol and carry it through the bloodstream. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is characterized by high cholesterol levels in the blood, which can lead to cardiovascular disease.\n",
        "FH is associated with a loss-of-function mutation of a gene that encodes LDL receptors in liver cells. Individuals who are heterozygous produce lower-than-normal amounts of the LDL receptors, and individuals who are homozygous for the mutant allele have no LDL receptor function.\n",
        "Individuals with FH can be treated with drugs that result in increased production of LDL receptors in liver cells. Which of the following best explains the observation that the drugs can effectively control blood cholesterol levels in individuals who are heterozygous but are not effective in individuals homozygous for the mutant allele?\n",
        "The drugs repair the mutant allele by copying the wild-type allele.\n",
        "The drugs prevent cholesterol from entering the liver cells in individuals who are heterozygous but not in individuals who are homozygous for the mutant allele.\n",
        "Cholesterol molecules primarily bind to HDL receptors in individuals with FH.\n",
        "There must be at least one copy of the wild-type LDL receptor allele to produce functional LDL receptors.\n",

        "Difficulty: 2\n",
        "The apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella, is native to North America and originally fed on fruit of the wild hawthorn. Since the mid-1800s, a population of flies has emerged that instead feed on domesticated apples. Apple maggot flies typically mate on or near the fruit of their host plants. Many varieties of apples ripen three to four weeks before the hawthorn fruits do.\n",
        "The different fruit preferences of the two fly populations will most likely have which of the following effects?\n",
        "The flies that eat hawthorn fruit will increase in number, while the flies that eat apples will decrease in number because of the use of insecticides on apple trees.\n",
        "The single fly species will evolve into two distinct species because of the lack of gene flow between the two populations.\n",
        "(Correct)\n",
        "The ability to survive on a diet of two different fruits will help the flies learn to eat many more types of fruit.\n",
        "The flies that eat hawthorn fruit will lay some of their eggs on the earlier-ripening apples to minimize competition among the larvae.\n",
